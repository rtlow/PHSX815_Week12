## Central Limit Theorem

We take samples from the same continuous distribution and take averages. As the number of averages becomes large, those averages will follow a Gaussian distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem.

# Dependencies

`numpy`

`matplotlib`


# Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `CentralLimit`.
